Sample rest API (pizza ordering service)

It's suppose to be public api, so there is not methods that could add pizzas or something like that. 

It's not done, but have examples of my style testing, layering, etc. 

Have no more time to complete/refactor it.

To start app:
```docker-compose up```

Than you can use REST-client to make api calls, default port: 1337. look at possible endpoints at `routes.ts`
